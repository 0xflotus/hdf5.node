## Get Started

```bash
npm install hdf5
```
If your native hdf5 libraries aren't at the default 
you can set the path with --hdf5_home_linux switch on this project as well as 
dependent projects.

```bash
npm install hdf5 --hdf5_home_linux=<your native hdf path>
```
For mac and windows the switches are --hdf5_home_mac & --hdf5_home_win

Because this project has native code look at [Install & Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/install-setup.html) for the details.
